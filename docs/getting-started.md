# Getting started with BSS-TrafficControl
## There are two main ways of getting started:
- [Using BSS-TrafficControl as a template](#using-it-as-a-template)
- [Using BSS-TrafficControl as a take-what-you-need repo](#take-what-you-need-repo)

### Using it as a template
Getting started with BSS-TrafficControl as a template is as simple as:
- Pulling the repo down from GitHub (This repo)
- Using `nodemon .` to test (Nodemon config is already set up)
- Visiting the website at `localhost` and the admin page at `localhost/admin/`

And it should be that easy!
However, it's a little different when editing since removing or changing something could break everything.
Editing the `protect.js` generator is not advised as that is one of the core elements of BSS-TrafficControl.

### Take what you need repo
This route is a little more complicated since it involves reading what is needed for other parts to work, though, it shouldn't be too difficult.

This is still a WIP so documentation is not ready, this will be updated when it is ready.

## Contributing
When you add new features to BSS-TrafficControl please be descriptive with what changes you have made and what they do and what parts they rely on. Update the documentation as you go so it's easier when it comes time to open a PR.
