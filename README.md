# BSS-TrafficControl
Another one of my take-what-you-need GitHub repos, basically: you take what you need and leave the rest.
You can get started at: [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md).

## Cool features
- Built in admin dashboard you can rip right out and make it your own.
- Example pages to show you how it works.
- Frontend protection.

## Asset links
To prevent other sites from stealing picture links, I've made generated asset links that can only be used once.
You might have dynamic content, you can still use these, when you're preparing new content to go to the frontend 
generate the links then.
